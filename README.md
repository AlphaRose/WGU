<h2 align="center">Why This Repository Exists</h2>

This repository is my living knowledge system.

When I made the decision to begin the Computer Science program at WGU, I struggled to find clear, consolidated information tailored to the questions I had. Course insights were scattered across forums, reviews were sporadic, and there wasn’t a single core location that offered structured, thoughtful breakdowns of what to expect.

I wanted clarity on everything. On workload, depth, difficulty, practical value, and how courses connected to real-world engineering work.

Since I couldn’t find the resource I was looking for, I decided to build it.

This repository documents my academic journey through structured notes, distilled concepts, implementation examples, and transparent course reviews. It exists both to strengthen my own mastery and to leave a lasting reference for others standing where I once stood. 

As a systems thinker, I believe knowledge compounds when it is organized, revisited, and refined.  (I also just really love data organization)

## What You’ll Find Here

- Clean, structured course notes including some concept breakdowns
- Code examples and applied exercises  
- Honest course reviews (workload, difficulty, key takeaways)

## Philosophy

I don’t believe in passive learning.

I believe in:
- Building durable mental models  
- Turning theory into implementation  
- Revisiting material until it becomes intuitive  
- Documenting the journey so others can benefit  

This repository is both a record of where I’ve been and a foundation for where I’m going. 

I am not sure how fair I will take this but I intend for it to go until landing a job in my degree path, maybe further.
