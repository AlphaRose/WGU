<h1 align="center">Courses</h1>

This is where I turn classes into systems.

Every course I take isn’t just something to pass, it’s something to extract from, refine, and integrate. I treat coursework the same way I treat engineering problems:

- Clear inputs  
- Defined constraints  
- Applied outputs  
- Documented lessons  
- Iteration over time  

This section isn’t a transcript.  
It’s a working knowledge base.

If I’m going to spend time learning something, I want it structured, reusable, and connected to the bigger system I’m building. (Both academically and professionally.)

# Starting Position

Like many, I didn’t start this program from zero.

According to my official WGU Transfer Evaluation (Effective 2/3/2026):

- **Total Program Competency Units:** 116  
- **Transfer Competency Units Awarded:** 39  
- **Credits Remaining:** 77  
- **Percent Completed at Start:** 33.62%  

I entered the BSCS → MSCS pathway with nearly one-third of the program already completed through prior coursework.

# Documentation Policy

This knowledge base is intentionally focused on the core classes only.

**General education courses will not be individually reviewed or expanded here.**

This repository exists as a technical systems archive, not a transcript mirror.
