## Why This Course Matters
Linux is not optional in modern engineering.  
It is infrastructure.

This course gives you a good exposure point and baseline for Linux knowledge. 
Any pathway you take from Computer Science you will likely need some level of Linux knowledge.

## Reflection

For me personally, this course felt mostly unnecessary from a technical perspective because I have been working with Linux for over a decade. 
I run a homelab, I am comfortable in the command line, and Linux based systems are already part of my normal workflow. Much of the material was review rather than new learning. 

That said, I understand why this course exists in the program. 
For students without prior Linux exposure, this is an excellent starter certification. It provides a strong baseline, introduces core operating system concepts, and gives structured exposure to command line fundamentals that are essential in modern engineering roles. 

It also adds a recognizable certification to your résumé, which can be valuable early in your career. 

If I were advising someone taking this course without prior experience, I would strongly recommend:
  - Building a small homelab alongside the coursework. 
  - Install Linux on a spare laptop if you have one.
  - If you do not, enable WSL on your Windows machine and practice there daily.
  - Work in the terminal every day, even if only for 15–20 minutes.
  - Practice navigating the filesystem, manipulating permissions, managing services, and writing small bash scripts. 

The certification objectives are important, but real comfort comes from repetition and hands-on experimentation. 
Linux is not something you memorize, it is something you use. The more time you spend inside the system, the more intuitive it becomes.
