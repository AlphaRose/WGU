# Official Certification Resources

Always start with the official objectives.  
They define the scope. Everything else supports them.

# GNU & Linux Documentation
All of these are **extremely** wordy and are best for reference if you run across something you do not understand. 
- [GNU Core Utilities Documentation](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/coreutils.html)
- [Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard](https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/fhs/index.html)
- [Bash Reference Manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html)

# Supplemental Learning
## Videos (For LPIC-1 which is mildly harder cert)
- [CBT Nuggets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOYpk4kq4k0&list=PLQVJk9oC5JKo_yO5Gje_IQJGxspNivHPG)
- [Chris Titus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10f4899srvc)

## Practice
- [Over The Wire Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/)
- [Jason Dion](https://www.udemy.com/course/linux-essentials-practice-exams/) I recommend his practice tests not the videos but many swear by his videos.
