Understanding how the program is built so I can move through it strategically.

## Overview

This section documents how the BSCS → MSCS pathway at WGU is structured.

Not course content.

Not assignments.

---

## Program Snapshot

- **Total Competency Units (CU):** 116  
- **Transfer Units Awarded:** 39  
- **Remaining Units:** 77  
- **Starting Completion Percentage:** 33.62%  

The program is competency based and term-based.

- Terms are six months long  
- Progress is measured in Competency Units (CU)  
- 12 CU is considered full time minimum, 8 for graduate studies  
- Acceleration is allowed within the term  

---

## Competency-Based Model

WGU is built around outcomes.

Each course is completed by passing one or more of the following:

- **Objective Assessment (OA)** – Proctored exam  
- **Performance Assessment (PA)** – Project-based submission  
- **Certification Exam** – External industry exam  (Will be labeled as PA on WGU course lists)

There is no weekly assignment model.  
There are defined completion checkpoints.

You move when you demonstrate mastery.

## Term Mechanics

Each term:

- Begins with an approved set of courses  
- Must meet the 12 CU minimum  
- Allows acceleration after baseline completion  
- Is guided by a program mentor  

Acceleration is possible, but implementation varies by mentor.

The strategic model:

1. Lock in required CU  
2. Complete efficiently  
3. Add courses incrementally  
4. Maintain submission velocity  

The system favors disciplined execution.

---

## Course Flow Model

Every course generally follows this lifecycle:

1. Course enrollment  
2. Course planning tool  
3. Study + preparation  
4. Pre-assessment (optional but strategic)  
5. Final OA or PA submission  
6. Evaluation + pass  

There is no partial credit.

It’s binary: competent or not yet.

## Structural Implications

Understanding program structure allows me to:

- Plan term CU strategically  
- Front load easier courses  
- Pair OA-heavy courses with PA-heavy ones  
- Avoid burnout stacking  
- Align pacing with professional goals

<h1 align="center">Bachelor’s to Master’s Transition Rule</h1>

One important structural detail:

Even if you complete all remaining bachelor’s coursework early, you **must finish the full six-month term** before moving into the graduate portion of the program.

The transition works like this:

1. Complete all remaining bachelor’s courses  
2. Remain enrolled through the end of the active term  
3. Apply for graduation (Bachelor’s degree)  
4. After conferral, begin Master’s coursework  

You cannot immediately roll into graduate classes midterm simply because you finished early.

The term must close first.

---

## Practical Implication

If bachelor’s coursework is completed quickly:
- You may have unused time within the term  
- You cannot begin graduate courses during that same term  (Outside of the 3 within the bachelors degree)
- Planning term timing becomes strategic  

This affects:
- Acceleration planning  
- Term load decisions  
- Long-term pacing toward the Master’s  

Finishing early does not override term structure.

The program is sequential, even though it is competency based.
