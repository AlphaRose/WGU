# First Mentor Meeting & Acceleration Reality

During my first meeting with my program mentor, I learned something important about how WGU pacing works in practice.

While WGU is competency-based and allows acceleration, mentors generally prefer that students stay around **12 competency units (CU)** during the first term.

The goal is stability first, acceleration second.

I had initially planned a heavier first term. However, most of those additional courses had to wait. My mentor automatically approved three extra courses beyond the standard load, but anything beyond that would need to be accelerated after I completed what was already on my plate.

That shifted my strategy.

Instead of front-loading everything at once, I moved to a rolling acceleration model.

## How Acceleration Worked (In My Case)

This next part varies by mentor.

In my situation:

- I was allowed to accelerate **two courses at a time**
- I needed to have final projects submitted *or* objective assessments scheduled for all currently active courses
- Once that condition was met, additional courses could be unlocked

In theory, WGU allows unlimited acceleration within a term.

In practice, there can be pacing controls:

- Mentors may limit how many courses can be active at once
- Acceleration may require demonstrated progress
- Some mentors may stop allowing accelerations after a certain point in the term (Like only a month left on term)

The policy is broad.  
The implementation is **very** mentor specific.

## Strategic Takeaway

Acceleration is possible.

But it is earned through:

- Completion velocity  
- Clear communication  
- Demonstrated followthrough  

The key is finishing strong, not stacking early.

Plan your term in layers:
1. Secure your baseline CU
2. Complete cleanly and quickly
3. Unlock the next layer
4. Repeat

I restructured my courses to have a base set of courses for the term and then accelerations in sets of two courses at a time. 

WGU is flexible but structure still wins.
